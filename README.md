# LANGUAGE ID BY PHONOLOGICAL NEIGHBOURHOOD NETWORK MEASUREMENTS
This repo is for a language game in which the program makes guesses about which language the user input belongs to. 

The user inputs a word in IPA (or other phonetic) symbols, and the program calculates network measurements of the word in three lexica (English, Dutch and German). Based on the calculations, the program concludes which of the three languages it most likely belongs to.

This is for the 530G final group project. Stanley (@stannam) and Cecilia (@LittleXianNv & @psyjc8) are members of the group.
