# LANGUAGE ID BY PHONOLOGICAL NEIGHBOURHOOD NETWORK MEASUREMENTS
This is a repo for a language game in which the program makes guesses about which language the user input belongs to. 

The user inputs a word in IPA (or other phonetic) symbols, and the program calculates network measurements of the word in three lexica (English, Dutch and German). Based on the calculations, the program concludes which of the three languages the user input most likely belongs to.

This is for the 530G final project.
